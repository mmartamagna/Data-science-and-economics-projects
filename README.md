## Project outline
1. Data
2. Analysis of variance (MANOVA, univariate one-way ANOVA)
3. Principal components analysis (PCA)
4. Multidimensional scaling (Classical MDS, Non-metric MDS, Distance-based redundancy analysis)
5. K-means clustering

### 1. Data
For the aim of this project, a subset of the original OECD data was prepared. The dataset, composed of 221 observations and 14 variables, contains all those countries belonging to the European continent. In particular, the considered geographical division of Europe is Western Europe, Central Europe, Southeast Europe, Southern Europe, British Isles, Scandinavia, and Northern Europe.
